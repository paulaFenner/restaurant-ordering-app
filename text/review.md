# Module #6: Essential JS Concepts

# Project: Restaurant Ordering App by Paula

# Code Reviewer: Shant Dashjian

## What You Did Well:

1. You met the objectives of this project:
   1. You followed the design spec. \*
   2. You rendered the menu options using JavaScript.
   3. It adds items to the order, gets the total, completes the order, and gets payment information. You can remove the item from the order.
   4. Your input fields are required.
2. You made the design and the app your own.
3. You added the month input.
4. Your validation is advanced using regex.
5. You code is well-organized and readable.
6. You followed CSS and JS naming conventions.
7. You worked on making the design responsive with relative units, flexbox, and media queries.
8. You used CSS variables for reusability.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

1. For a smoother reset, instead of window.location.reload(), create a reset() function that essentailly brings back the initial HTML for the order container and hides it.
2. Handle the form submit event, not the button click event, in order to show the validation errors.
3. For a narrower screen, keep the shape of the buttons circular.
4. Challenge: Rather than adding the same item multiple times on separate lines, can you add it onces and then add something like x2 next to it?

## Conclusion:

You did very well meeting and exceeding the objectives of this project, practicing a good number of JavaScript concepts. I hope you found my suggestions useful and I wish you the best in your journey. Keep on coding.
